# MeloD
Where music meets Data! Note: project requires your own .env file and vars.

## Inspiration
Services exist that generate playlists based on your mood, but we wanted to do the opposite, and analyze the user's mood based on their songs. There are many use cases for NLP in mental health and this is only one of them. As AI becomes increasingly more prominent, it's interesting to see well-being and mental health apps change. This interest and initial idea combined sparked the idea of MeloD.

## What it does
- MeloD uses sentiment analysis to analyze the sentiment behind your song lyrics and track your mental wellbeing encouraging mood reflection / self-improvement.

# Technical Challenges 
- The template was incredibly hard to work with lots of unnecessary files, but I guess it looked nice!
- Not a lot of resources on Spotify API (listening history) + React
- Never worked with Genius or Spotify API
- Setting up authentication system/working with APIs, by far the most frustrating thing
- Not completely finished

# REAL Challenges
- Two teammates left mid hack, one to join another team, and the other was busy
- Two teammates left, one doesn't know React/JS too well
- starting over
- Many Node packages

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- This is the first time I've ever worked with a template that was so unnecessarily complex and I made it work!
- This is the first time I've ever worked with the Spotify API / Genius API and I got Spotify auth to work / some Spotify GET
- I've never gone through interacting APIs and React until now. I learned a lot!! :D
- I finished most of this in a day because I had to start over, and also I'm finishing up at 5am :) woo I pulled through! No sleep, two all nighters baby I'm so cool
- The research was done pretty well and the slides looked very nice overall given the time constraints and setbacks!!

## What's next for MeloD
I (Catherine) actually plan on working on this. I've been working on a journaling web app that takes your journal entries, logs them in a data base and tracks your well being with React as a frontend and Django as a backend. I can incorporate this idea of logging Spotify Data as well/borrow from work I already did here. It'd be even nicer if I can expand to generating playlists based on logged data.
